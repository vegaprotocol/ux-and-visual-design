# ux-and-visual-design

This repository exists as a place for the UX & Visual Design team to prioritise, plan and track their work across all Vega frontend apps, sites and tools and materials.

This is not a repository (at least for now) where design work or assets themselves will be stored as this work is all currently done and stored in third party tools like Miro and Figma.
