# ux-and-visual-design

This repository exists as a place for the UX & Visual Design team to prioritise, plan and track their work across all Vega frontend apps, sites, tools and marketing materials etc.

No design work or design assets will be stored here as it is all currently done and stored in third party tools like Miro and Figma.

You can find Vega brand assets and guidelines here: https://github.com/vegaprotocol/brand

You can find the Vega design system here: COMING SOON
